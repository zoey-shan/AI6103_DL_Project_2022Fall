# AI6103 Project: U-Net Regularizations

In this project, we try to apply different regularization methods on the U-Net model to solve the over-fitting problem. 

This repository contains all of our the experiment code. We arrange the codes of different methods into different branches, which names according to the regularization method name (l1&l2, Dropout, data augmentation, early stopping and receptive field regularization). And our project report is uploaded into the main branch.
