# AI6103 Project: U-Net Regularizations

In this project, we try to apply different regularization methods to the U-Net model to solve the over-fitting problem. 

This repository contains all of our the experiment codes. We arrange the codes of different methods into different branches, which are named according to the regularization method name (l1&l2, Dropout, data augmentation, early stopping and receptive field regularization). And our project report is uploaded into the main branch.
